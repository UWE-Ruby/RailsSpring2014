Code:
  Deploy your application to Heroku
  get email set up
  Convert your views to haml (can be pushed back)

Questions:
1. What is Haml and why do we use it?
"HTML abstraction markup language" -
a (mostly) ruby-specific markup language specialized for generating {X}HTML.
Unlike erb, it can't generate freeform content,
but it is pretty crisp and terse for generating HTML.
We would use it over erb because it is tidier looking,
more concise,
and doesn't require us to close our tags.
On the downside, it means learning *yet another* DSL.
