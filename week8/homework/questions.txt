Questions:
1. What is Haml and why do we use it?

  HAML stands for HTML Abstraction Markup Language. It is a nicer alternative to ERB. We use it because HTML clutters up views and introduces a lot more room for error.

  "We" [my day job] *don't* use it. But I was smitten the day I first saw example code in HAML and looked it up. I did read Chris Eppstein's "Haml Sucks for Content" post and it scared me off. But I am intrigued again.
