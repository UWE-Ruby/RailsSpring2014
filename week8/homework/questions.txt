Questions:
1. What is Haml and why do we use it?
Haml, which stands for HTML abstraction markup language, was born out of creator Hampton Catlin's frustration with hand-typing templates.
What Catlin came up with was, as described by Obie Fernandez in The Rails 4 Way, a "whitespace-sensitive" HTML templating engine that
makes use of indentation to determine the hierarchy of an HTML document. Haml does away with angle brackets and eschews the need to close blocks
and HTML tags.

Developers use Haml because it enables them to focus on the structure of the page.
