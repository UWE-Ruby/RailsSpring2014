Reading:
  Chapter 14 authetication and authorization (used pundit, but R will use can-can and rollify)
  Chapter 16 action Mailer
Code:
  Add devise for login/logout with tests
  Add one ActionMailer with tests

Questions:
  1. What is devise and why should we use it instead of creating our own login pattern?
  Devise is an authentication / login framework for use with Rails.
  I would use it because it's popular -
  security is almost always something where it it is better to use something
  tried and proven than it is to roll your own.
  2. How would devise require login before the home action on a welcome controller?

  class WelcomController < ApplicationController
    before_action :authenticate_user!
  end

  3. If I wanted to send an email each time a resource in my application was created how would I do it? (Pretend I have a FunMailer ActionMailer class with a notify_about_resource method)
  4. What is Authorization? How is it different from Authentication?
  Authorization is the process of allowing a user to perform certain actions.
  It is a completely separate idea from Authentication,
  which is the process of proving that a user is who they say they are 
  (not necessarily a real-world identity,
  but at least the same identity that originally created the account.)
  Usually one Authenticates before Authorizing, 
  but some actions could be authorized for anyone.
