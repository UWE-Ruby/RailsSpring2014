Code:
  Add devise for login/logout with tests
  Add one ActionMailer with tests

Questions:
  1. What is devise and why should we use it instead of creating our own login pattern?
  Devise is a Rack-based, authentication solution for Rails applications. It is based on Warden.
  Devise provides several standard features out of the box. It does not require much code writing.
  Rails has a has_secure_password mechanism, but unlike Devise, one would need to
  implement some extra items so that has_secure_password will run properly.
  

  2. How would devise require login before the home action on a welcome controller?
  In app/controllers/welcome_controller.rb, add
  before_action :authenticate_user! 
  
  3. If I wanted to send an email each time a resource in my application was created how would I do it? (Pretend I have a FunMailer ActionMailer class with a notify_about_resource method)
	Go to the controller and edit the create action to include a call to FunMailer.notify_about_resource:
	if @user.save
		FunMailer.notify_about_resource(@user).deliver

  4. What is Authorization? How is it different from Authentication?
  Authorization verifies what users can do. Authentication verifies a user's identity.
