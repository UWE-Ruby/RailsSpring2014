Code:
  Add devise for login/logout with tests
  Add one ActionMailer with tests

Questions:
  1. What is devise and why should we use it instead of creating our own login pattern?

	Devise is a ruby gem that allows you to add user authentication to your web application, thus denying access to anyone who doesn't have the proper credentials. It's preferable to use Devise because it allows us to add user authentication much faster than coding it ourselves, and it's guaranteed to be secure.

  2. How would devise require login before the home action on a welcome controller?

  	before_filter :authenticate_user!

  3. If I wanted to send an email each time a resource in my application was created how would I do it? (Pretend I have a FunMailer ActionMailer class with a notify_about_resource method)

	def welcome_email user
		@user = user
		mail(to: @user.email, subject: "Welcome to the site!")
	end

  4. What is Authorization? How is it different from Authentication?

	Authorization checks what you are authorized to do (such as accessing certain parts of a website, creating/editing/destroying database entries, etc.). Authentication verifies who you are so you can access the information/options available to you on a website.
