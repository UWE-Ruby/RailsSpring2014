  Add one ActionMailer with tests

Questions:
  1. What is devise and why should we use it instead of creating our own login pattern?

  2. How would devise require login before the home action on a welcome controller?

  3. If I wanted to send an email each time a resource in my application was created how would I do it? (Pretend I have a FunMailer ActionMailer class with a notify_about_resource method)
  
  4. What is Authorization? How is it different from Authentication?
