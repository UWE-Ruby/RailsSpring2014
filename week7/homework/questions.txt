Code:
  Add devise for login/logout with tests
  Add one ActionMailer with tests

Questions:
  1. What is devise and why should we use it instead of creating our own login pattern?
     Devise is a ruby gem that provides libraries to implement authentication in rails applications. We should use devise:
     a. Building own authentication system comes with a risk as every one doesnâ€™t know the nuances of such system. Devise is a standard library used by many applications and thoroughly tested.
     b. It has comprehensive set of features that can be enabled/disabled selectively based on need.
     c. Makes development lot faster.

  2. How would devise require login before the home action on a welcome controller?
     before_action :authenticate_user! can be used in welcome controller to require login before the home action.

  3. If I wanted to send an email each time a resource in my application was created how would I do it? (Pretend I have a FunMailer ActionMailer class with a notify_about_resource method)
     The following code should be added in the new method of controller for the resource.
     email = FunMailer.notify_about_resource(resource)
     email.deliver

  4. What is Authorization? How is it different from Authentication?
    Authorization identifies "what" one can do, where as Authentication identifies "who" one is.
    For example both a student and teacher can log into school website, but student can see only his grades where as teacher
    can see grades of all students in class. The process of identifying whether one is student or teacher is called 
    Authentication, where the process that identifies what a student or teacher can do after logging into system is
    called Authorization.
