Code:
  Add devise for login/logout with tests
  Add one ActionMailer with tests

Questions:
  1. What is devise and why should we use it instead of creating our own login pattern?
  
  Devise is an authentication solution based on Warden. It should be used becuase it is well tested, reliable and relatively easy to setup.

  2. How would devise require login before the home action on a welcome controller?
  
  before_filter :authenticate_user!

  3. If I wanted to send an email each time a resource in my application was created how would I do it? (Pretend I have a FunMailer ActionMailer class with a notify_about_resource method)

  def welcome_email user 
  	@user = user
  	mail(to: @user.email, subject: 'Welcome to this site!')
  end


  4. What is Authorization? How is it different from Authentication?

  Authorization verifies what you are authorized to do. Authentication verifies who you are.
