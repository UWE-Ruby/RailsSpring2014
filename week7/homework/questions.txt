Code:
  Add devise for login/logout with tests
  Add one ActionMailer with tests

Questions:
  1. What is devise and why should we use it instead of creating our own login pattern?

  Devise has been tested and has additional add ons that can be implemented, such as facebook login, etc. 

  2. How would devise require login before the home action on a welcome controller?

  by using a before method that prompts a sign on on the welcome controller

  3. If I wanted to send an email each time a resource in my application was created how would I do it? (Pretend I have a FunMailer ActionMailer class with a notify_about_resource method)

  edit the app/controllers/users_controller.rb make it instruct the UserMailer to deliver an email when the action is completed by editing the create action and inserting a call to UserMailer.welcome_email right after the action is completed .

  4. What is Authorization? How is it different from Authentication?

  Authorization allows access to certain parts of your websites functionality, Authenticatin is the process of proving someone's identity.
