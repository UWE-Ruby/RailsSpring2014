Code:
  Add devise for login/logout with tests
  Add one ActionMailer with tests

Questions:
  1. What is devise and why should we use it instead of creating our own login pattern?
  	Devise is industry standard. Learning to use and integrate it instead of making your own method will be far more effecient, since other devs should also know devise.

  2. How would devise require login before the home action on a welcome controller?
    Put the autenticate_user! before filter in the applicaiton controller.

  3. If I wanted to send an email each time a resource in my application was created how would I do it? (Pretend I have a FunMailer ActionMailer class with a notify_about_resource method)

  call the notify_about_resource method in an after_create filter in the resource model
  
  4. What is Authorization? How is it different from Authentication?

    Authorization specifies what resources a user is alloed to use, while authentication is used for login to make sure the user is who they say they are.
