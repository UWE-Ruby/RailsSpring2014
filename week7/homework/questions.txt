Code:
  Add devise for login/logout with tests
  Add one ActionMailer with tests

Questions:
  1. What is devise and why should we use it instead of creating our own login pattern?

  Devise is a gem that provides authentication. There are many good reasons to use it or another gem rather than rolling your own authentication. It is the most commonly used authentication gem, so you are very likely to encounter it in existing sites. Other members of your team and successors will probably know it. It saves you from writing a lot of code and gets you right to the important stuff -- testing and actually restricting access to resources. It is very robust and flexible.

  2. How would devise require login before the home action on a welcome controller?

  One way to do it would be to add to WelcomeController:

  before_filter :authenticate_user!, :only => [:home]

  3. If I wanted to send an email each time a resource in my application was created how would I do it? (Pretend I have a FunMailer ActionMailer class with a notify_about_resource method)

  Using an after filter on the resource's create method to call FunMailer.notify_about_resource would work.

  4. What is Authorization? How is it different from Authentication?

  Authentication is establishing a user's identity. Authorization is allowing access to a resource.
