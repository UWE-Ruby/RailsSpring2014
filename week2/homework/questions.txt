Reading:
Chapter 4 Working with Controllers: 4.3 - 4.7  (Skip the rack console exercise - unless you really want to do it)
Chapter 2 Routing: 2.1, 2.2, 2.4, 2.6, 2.7 

Code: (I created a seperate app called RailsHomeWork. Links to the checkins corresponding to homework are given below) 
Setup a root route to a home or welcome controller 
Have a link on your homepage to your scaffolded resource from last week
Have a link on your homepage that triggers a change on your homepage (wording change, expansion of text, change a color, etc...)
Create a view helper that will generate different content on your homepage based on a param value

Questions:
1. Why does a Rails app have routing?
   Routing in rails exists for two purposes:
   a. It maps requests to controller actions
   b. It generates URLs dynamically 
2. How would you render the same view for two different controllers? (code example is fine)
  Same view can be rendered from two different controllers by using explicit "render" statement in teh controller action.
  render "<path to template file>"
  Ex: render "/home/index.html"
3. If you wanted to check a parameter before calling any controller action, what would you do? (code example is fine)
  
  I would define an action call back to be executed before the action as below:

  class Wee2HomeWorkController
  		before_action :validate_params

  		def actionName
  			.
  			.
  			.
  		end

  	  private

  	  	def validate_params
  	  		# Validate that parameter p_name is present always
  	  		params.require(:p_name)
  	  	end
  end
