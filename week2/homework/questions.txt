Reading:
Chapter 4 Working with Controllers: 4.3 - 4.7  (Skip the rack console exercise - unless you really want to do it)
Chapter 2 Routing: 2.1, 2.2, 2.4, 2.6, 2.7 

Code:
Setup a root route to a home or welcome controller
Have a link on your homepage to your scaffolded resource from last week
Have a link on your homepage that triggers a change on your homepage (wording change, expansion of text, change a color, etc...)
Create a view helper that will generate different content on your homepage based on a param value

Questions:
1. Why does a Rails app have routing? 
To tell your app what to do when it receives a request, and to allow dynamic URL generation. 

2. How would you render the same view for two different controllers?
Explicitly calling render: <view> in your controllers.

3. If you wanted to check a parameter before calling any controller action, what would you do? (code example is fine)
Output to console?
