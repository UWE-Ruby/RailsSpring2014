Chapter 4 Working with Controllers: 4.3 - 4.7  (Skip the rack console exercise - unless you really want to do it)
Chapter 2 Routing: 2.1, 2.2, 2.4, 2.6, 2.7 

Code:
Setup a root route to a home or welcome controller
✓
Have a link on your homepage to your scaffolded resource from last week
✓
Have a link on your homepage that triggers a change on your homepage (wording change, expansion of text, change a color, etc...)
✓
Create a view helper that will generate different content on your homepage based on a param value
✓

Questions:
1. Why does a Rails app have routing? 
To dynamically pass along http requests to controllers with correct parameters
- ie, providing RESTful addresses for views that do not exist until they are
requested.
2. How would you render the same view for two different controllers? (code example is fine)
First, I would ask why.
Having gotten a plausible answer, I would add 
  render "somebody/elses/view"
to the 'additional' controller. But how do I get the environment in there?

3. If you wanted to check a parameter before calling any controller action, what would you do? (code example is fine)
'action' = method
or 
'action' = something done from / inside a method?
for the second, one might parse params before the render; check if they are
sensible, turn some of them into booleans, so forth. The boolean part is what I
am struggling with right now, is how to pass true and false. The params are
apparently all Strings before they reach us.

For the first, I got nothing.
