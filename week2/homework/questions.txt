Reading:
Chapter 4 Working with Controllers: 4.3 - 4.7  (Skip the rack console exercise - unless you really want to do it)
Chapter 2 Routing: 2.1, 2.2, 2.4, 2.6, 2.7 

Code:
Setup a root route to a home or welcome controller
Have a link on your homepage to your scaffolded resource from last week
Have a link on your homepage that triggers a change on your homepage (wording change, expansion of text, change a color, etc...)
Create a view helper that will generate different content on your homepage based on a param value

Questions:
1. Why does a Rails app have routing? 
To tell your browser where to go
2. How would you render the same view for two different controllers? (code example is fine)
def index
  @students = Student.all
end

def display_students
  @students = Student.all
end

3. If you wanted to check a parameter before calling any controller action, what would you do? (code example is fine)
evaluate it by putting code into the helper, then in the view call the method that was added to the helper
