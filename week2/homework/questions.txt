Chapter 4 Working with Controllers: 4.3 - 4.7  (Skip the rack console exercise - unless you really want to do it)
Chapter 2 Routing: 2.1, 2.2, 2.4, 2.6, 2.7 

Code:
Setup a root route to a home or welcome controller X
Have a link on your homepage to your scaffolded resource from last week X
Have a link on your homepage that triggers a change on your homepage (wording change, expansion of text, change a color, etc...) X
Create a view helper that will generate different content on your homepage based on a param value X

Questions:
1. Why does a Rails app have routing? 
	A rails app has routing to direct requests to their correct location in the application. For example the HTTP verb GET for the /photos would run the controller action photos#index and display a list of photos. The router provides a easy to understand way to add navigation for HTTP requests in your application.

2. How would you render the same view for two different controllers? (code example is fine)
	You could hardcode the view in the controllers using the render option. Add this code to both controllers.

	def index
		render '/derp/index.html.haml'
	end



3. If you wanted to check a parameter before calling any controller action, what would you do? (code example is fine)

	You can use a Action Callback to acheivice this.. for example

	class WaterController < ActionController::Base
	  before_action :check_parameter

	  protected
	  def check_parameter
	    # check the parameter before any actions are ran
	  end

	end
