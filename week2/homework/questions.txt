Reading:
Chapter 4 Working with Controllers: 4.3 - 4.7  (Skip the rack console exercise - unless you really want to do it)
Chapter 2 Routing: 2.1, 2.2, 2.4, 2.6, 2.7 

Code:
1. Setup a root route to a home or welcome controller 
	Done
	get 'home', to: 'static_pages#home', as: :home

2. Have a link on your homepage to your scaffolded resource from last week
	I am still unsure how to do this.

3. Have a link on your homepage that triggers a change on your homepage (wording change, expansion of text, change a color, etc...)

Create a view helper that will generate different content on your homepage based on a param value

Questions:
1. Why does a Rails app have routing? 
The Rails router recognizes URLs and dispatches them to a controller's action. It can also generate paths and URLs, avoiding the need to hardcode strings in your views.

2. How would you render the same view for two different controllers? (code example is fine)
In my microposts controller I have 
def thanks format_html render 'static_pages/about'
  end
  In my static_pages controller I have
  def thanks format_html render 'static_pages/about'
  end
  In routes.rb I have
  get 'thanks', to 'static_pages#about', as: :about

3. If you wanted to check a parameter before calling any controller action, what would you do? (code example is fine)
match '/about' => 'pages#show', :defaults => { :id => 'about' }
