Reading:
Chapter 4 Working with Controllers: 4.3 - 4.7  (Skip the rack console exercise - unless you really want to do it)
Chapter 2 Routing: 2.1, 2.2, 2.4, 2.6, 2.7 

Code:
Setup a root route to a home or welcome controller
Have a link on your homepage to your scaffolded resource from last week
Have a link on your homepage that triggers a change on your homepage (wording change, expansion of text, change a color, etc...)
Create a view helper that will generate different content on your homepage based on a param value

Questions:
1. Why does a Rails app have routing? 

Routing allows you to create new pages, and allows you set a root route. 

2. How would you render the same view for two different controllers? (code example is fine)

You would want to use partials, where one depends on the other being true to render itself. 

3. If you wanted to check a parameter before calling any controller action, what would you do? (code example is fine)

I believe you would check the param in the Model.
