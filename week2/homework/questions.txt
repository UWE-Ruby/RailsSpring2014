Reading:
Chapter 4 Working with Controllers: 4.3 - 4.7  (Skip the rack console exercise - unless you really want to do it)
Chapter 2 Routing: 2.1, 2.2, 2.4, 2.6, 2.7 

Code:
Setup a root route to a home or welcome controller
Have a link on your homepage to your scaffolded resource from last week
Have a link on your homepage that triggers a change on your homepage (wording change, expansion of text, change a color, etc...)
Create a view helper that will generate different content on your homepage based on a param value

Questions:
1. Why does a Rails app have routing? 
Rails routing auotmatically recognizes code to generate URLs. It also sends these automatically to the controller.
2. How would you render the same view for two different controllers? (code example is fine)
You could have two different routes in the routes.rb file.
3. If you wanted to check a parameter before calling any controller action, what would you do? (code example is fine)
