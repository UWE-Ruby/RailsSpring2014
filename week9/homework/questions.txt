Come to class prepared to present your project.
You should be ready to answer these questions:

What 3 things would you have done differently with your project?
	I would have used a gem to managed the self-join relationship I had
	I would not have reorganized by database the first time from a one-to-many self join to a many-to-many through self-join
	I would have let devise make my user class first then add to it, as opposed to trying to integrate the already-created class into devise


What 3 things do you want to add to your project?
	A user account settings page
	cascasing sub-goal listings on the goals page, so only the 
	supergoals initially appear
	a compilied list of all the entries a user has made for one goal --

	so you can see the story of the journey


What 3 things do you wish you knew when you started?
	
	its all about how you organize your information
	sometimes you have to be really explicit with rails for it to figure out what you want. It's not completely magical.
	how important correctly naming things is -- in terms of plurialization, especially


What 3 things did you learn that I didnâ€™t go over in class?
	I leaned a lot about self-joining relationships, both as one-to-many and has many :through varities
	I leaned some basic things about scss and formatting to make things look pretty (or, less ugly)
	There's a gem for everything
