				Week 9 Homework

Come to class prepared to present your project.
You should be ready to answer these questions:

What 3 things would you have done differently with your project?

	  1. Better data model planning (don't name your columns
	   'type').
	  2. Don't try to immediately customize everything--get 
	  the basic version running first.
	  3. Written tests first, then code.

What 3 things do you want to add to your project?

	1. Garden tracking--planting and harvesting 
	  schedules/calendars, predicted harvest quantities, 
	  severe weather warnings (via a weather API), 
	  composting and soil tools
    2. Animal management--stats for farm animals, 
       feed calculators, breeding and health trackers, 
       milking stats 
    3. Farm project tracking--a general project tool 
    	for managing tasks like installing/repairing 
    	fences, building shelters, digging ponds, etc. 

What 3 things do you wish you knew when you started? 

	1. That Rails is truly a DSL--you're not really 
	   writing in Ruby.
	2. That when I have trouble finding information 
	    about what I'm debugging, I'm probably debugging 
	    the wrong thing.
	3. How easy it is to procrastinate with CSS. 

What 3 things did you learn that I didnâ€™t go over in class?

	1. Bootstrap gem
	2. Sass basics
	3. Writing routing tests
