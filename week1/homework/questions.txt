Reading:
Chapter 1 - Section 1.1 on Bundler
Chapter 3 REST, Resources, andRails - Sections 3.1 - 3.6

Code:
Create new rails app
Add a ruby version and gemset to it
Add one page of static content
Create one Resource with Scaffolding
Put it on Github

Questions:
1. What is the difference between Bundler and RVM?
Bundler is used to ensure the correct gems are installed when required by a gemfile. RVM is used to manage versions of ruby and gemsets (of installed gems) for different projects.
2. What is REST and why is it useful?
REST is a network "architectural style" that puts constraints on how systems interact with each other. One of the reasons it's useful is the convenience it provides for routing, and the standardization it promotes with said convenience by following CRUD naming conventions. 
3. What does CRUD stand for? 
Create, read, update, destroy. 
4. What does this line of code do, and what file in my rails app would it go in?
   resources :students, except: :destroy
It limits the routes that get generated for the students resource, and it goes in routes.rb.
