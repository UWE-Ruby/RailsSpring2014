Chapter 1 - Section 1.1 on Bundler
Chapter 3 REST, Resources, andRails - Sections 3.1 - 3.6

Code:
Create new rails app
Add a ruby version and gemset to it
Add one page of static content
Create one Resource with Scaffolding
Put it on Github

Questions:
1. What is the difference between Bundler and RVM?

    RVM and rbenv manage Ruby versions. Bundler manages gems.

2. What is REST and why is it useful?

    REST (REpresentational State Transfer) is an architechtural style for distributed hypermedia systems. I love the quote at the beginning of Chapter 3 in The Rails 4 Way: 

      "Before REST came I (and pretty much everyone else) never really knew where to put stuff." -- Jonas Nicklas

    The above quote pretty clearly explains why the REST architectural style is useful. REST give you constraints that work well for web applications. It helps you quickly decide where to put stuff and how to map access to your resources.

3. What does CRUD stand for? 

    Create Read Update Delete

4. What does this line of code do, and what file in my rails app would it go in?
   resources :students, except: :destroy

    This would reside in config/routes.rb. It would give you the following routes:

          Prefix Verb   URI Pattern                  Controller#Action
        students GET    /students(.:format)          students#index
                 POST   /students(.:format)          students#create
     new_student GET    /students/new(.:format)      students#new
    edit_student GET    /students/:id/edit(.:format) students#edit
         student GET    /students/:id(.:format)      students#show
                 PATCH  /students/:id(.:format)      students#update
                 PUT    /students/:id(.:format)      students#update
