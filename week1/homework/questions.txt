Reading:
Chapter 1 - Section 1.1 on Bundler
Chapter 3 REST, Resources, andRails - Sections 3.1 - 3.6

Code:
Create new rails app
Add a ruby version and gemset to it
Add one page of static content
Create one Resource with Scaffolding
Put it on Github

Questions:
1. What is the difference between Bundler and RVM?
Bundler has to do with the gems we want to install, RVM manages the versions
of ruby and lets us have different buckets to install gems.

2. What is REST and why is it useful?
Okay, without reading the book yet, REST is an interface for interaction with
databases. You are able to access the REST interface, typically through http
where you can add/retrieve information from a database. Most common API are REST based.
(we will see if that holds up after i do the reading :o)

3. What does CRUD stand for? 
Create, Read, Update, Destroy
4. What does this line of code do, and what file in my rails app would it go in?
   resources :students, except: :destroy
It would go in the routes.rb file
It would creaet a route for students but not for destroy

Project Description:
I am still thinking about this. Maybe a server metadata service, something similar
to what AWS instances have but in non AWS envioronments.
