Chapter 3 REST, Resources, andRails - Sections 3.1 - 3.6

Code:
Create new rails app
Add a ruby version and gemset to it
Add one page of static content
Create one Resource with Scaffolding
Put it on Github

Questions:
1. What is the difference between Bundler and RVM?
-->RVM is used to designate a Ruby version and an associated Gemset.  It does not manage dependencies among gems.  Bundler is a tool that manages gems and gem dependencies.
2. What is REST and why is it useful?
-->REST is an acronym for Representational State Transfer.  It is useful in determining the design of database-back applications.
3. What does CRUD stand for? 
-->Create, Read, Update, and Destroy.
4. What does this line of code do, and what file in my rails app would it go in?
   resources :students, except: :destroy
-->This could be found in the routes.rb file in the rails config directory.  It creates three named routes, corresponding to the Create, Read, and Update actions for the Students controller.

Project Description:
I'm going to work on an MP3 cataloguer / organizer.  Not quite sure about the scope and requirements, but it will build on what I did in the first term.
