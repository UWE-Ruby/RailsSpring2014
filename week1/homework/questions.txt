Answers
1-	RVM manages the multiple versions of Ruby on the same machine. Gemsets  of RVM is a powerful feature, it isolates the gems for one application/library from the rest of your system. 
Bundler manages the gem installations based on your Gemfile and it tells where the gems
should go and it installs them into the RVM folder. 
2-	REST (Representational State Transfer) is a software architecture style that consists of a set of architectural constraints applied to components, connectors and data elements. It is a web-based communication style, it lets the application to talk to servers in a unique fashion.
3-	CRUD stands for Create/Read/Update/Delete. It is an abbreviation for database operations. 
4-	Resource routing allows you to quickly declare all of the common routes for a given resourceful controller. Instead of declaring separate routes for your index, show, new, edit, create, update and destroy actions, a resourceful route declares them in a single line of code. “except: :destroy” generates all routes except for the given actions.
