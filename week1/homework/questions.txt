Questions:

1. What is the difference between Bundler and RVM?

	Bundler is a dependency resolution tool for a given application, where as RVM lets one manage multiple versions of ruby environments through gem sets.

2. What is REST and why is it useful?
	
	REST (Representational State Transfer) defines a way of communication between software system's components (in the context of rails, a web application) by imposing constraints on their interactions.

	It is useful as it provides uniform inteface for interaction between different components of system/s.


3. What does CRUD stand for? 

	CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update and Delete operations ususally of database and in the context of rails, routes mentioned in routes.rb map to one of these operations (usually) through controller actions.

4. What does this line of code do, and what file in my rails app would it go in?
   resources :students, except: :destroy

   The above line goes into routes.rb file under config and would create all default routes mapping to students controller actions except for "destroy" action.
