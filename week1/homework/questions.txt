Reading:
Chapter 1 - Section 1.1 on Bundler
Chapter 3 REST, Resources, andRails - Sections 3.1 - 3.6

Code:
Create new rails app
Add a ruby version and gemset to it
Add one page of static content
Create one Resource with Scaffolding
Put it on Github

Questions:
1. What is the difference between Bundler and RVM?
RVM is a ruby manager that allows the programmer to use multiple versions of ruby on a single machine. Bundler installs the exact gem versions needed for the particular application.
2. What is REST and why is it useful?
REST is representational state transfer and utilizes unambiguous URIs to simplify data transfer and its stateless architecture is particularly helpful with HTTP, webpages and XML.
3. What does CRUD stand for? 
Create, read, update and delete.
4. What does this line of code do, and what file in my rails app would it go in?
   resources :students, except: :destroy

Project Description:
My project is related to renewable energy. In the previous trimester I coded a gem that reads in and processes data generated by the Aurora PowerOne AC/DC inverter which I have at home as part of a solar energy generation system. The functionality of the gem is to read in the file and store the amount of energy generated by the user and make requisite calculations like the amount of carbon that was offset due to the production of renewable energy versus the aggregate grid as a whole. 

In this trimester I would like this functionality to be web-enabled and allow any other renewable energy system owners to also track their energy production and carbon sequestration as well. They would obviously have to hve the same inverter but eventually I would have scripts for most of the popular inverters. Specifically I would like to have the following functionality:

A user sign-up, login, logout, and password reset
A mechanism by which the user's inverter generated files could be harvested (this could be tricky, but manual uploading of the file by the user is a start).
A user page that show users' energy and power profiles
Allow users to see other users
Assemble lists of users by ranking power/energy and other metrics and have an output page for lists
Assemble totals of all users and have an output page for totals
Indicate a user's net carbon sequestration impact
