Reading:
Chapter 1 - Section 1.1 on Bundler
Chapter 3 REST, Resources, andRails - Sections 3.1 - 3.6

Code:
Create new rails app
Add a ruby version and gemset to it
Add one page of static content
Create one Resource with Scaffolding
Put it on Github

Questions:
1. What is the difference between Bundler and RVM?
Bundler is a very useful tool that will get and install all the gems 
you need to run an application (it uses the gems and versions specified 
in an applications gemfile). This is much easier than installing each
gem by hand! RVM on the other hand is a tool that allows you to install 
and switch between multiple versions of Ruby. It also allows you to switch 
between 'gemsets' or bundles of gems since different gems/versions can
sometimes conflict. When used together, RVM tells bundler where to
install the gems. 

2. What is REST and why is it useful?
REST stands for Representational State Transfer, it is a simple way 
to organize interactions between different systems. RESTful applications 
use HTTP requests to post data (create and/or update), read data, and 
delete data.

3. What does CRUD stand for? 
CRUD stands for the four basic functions (Create, Read, Update,
Delete) that are done on a database.

4. What does this line of code do, and what file in my rails app would it go in?
resources :students, except: :destroy
You can use this line of code to generate routes that are mapped to a
controller action. This line creates all routes (index, show, new,
edit, create, update) for Student but excludes destroy.

Project Description:
I would like to build on my previous gem idea but expand it into a web
application with a user interface that allows users to enter the
website url they want to conduct the search on. I also want to return
the results as a nice table.
