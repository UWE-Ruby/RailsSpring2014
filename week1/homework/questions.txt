Bundler solves dependency issues for your gems, while RVM allows you to manage different versions of Ruby on your system. 

2. What is REST and why is it useful?

REST is an architectural style, and it is useful because it creates the restraints that facilitate communication with the World Wide Web.

3. What does CRUD stand for? 

Create Read Update Delete

4. What does this line of code do, and what file in my rails app would it go in?
   resources :students, except: :destroy

You would make this call in routes.rb, and it would destroy everything except students.
