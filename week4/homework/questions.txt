  Add 2 relationships to your app:
    1. Has Many (one-to-many)
    2. Has Many Through (many-to-many)
  Add 2 named scopes

Questions:
1. What is ActiveRecord and why is it useful?
Active Record is a pattern identified by Martin Fowler in his book "Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture."
It maps one domain class to one database table, and one instance of that class to each row of the database.
The Active Record approach, as described by Fowler, puts data access logic in the domain object.

2. What problems could happen if you change a migration file after you have run it and committed it to github? (list 2)
You can mess up your app if you edit a migration that's already been run in multiple environments.
If you edit the migration and run the migration again (as opposed to writing a new migration), Rails will not do anything
if you do rake db:migrate because Rails thinks it has already run that migration.


3. What problems can you run into with the Rails has_and_belongs_to_many method? (list 2)
Renee calls habtm "evil, bad, ugly." 
Habtm is not flexible. It automatically creates a table in between; the only two columns in the table are the primary keys of the two other tables.
Should requirements change, you need a way to easily change things. Habtm is not recommended because you can't make changes to the intersection table.


4. How is Rails form_for object oriented?
The form_for  method yields a form object. One can use input helper methods on the object,
omitting their first argument.


5. How would I use postgres in production and sqlite for development? What files would I change and how would I change them?
Go to the Gemfile, where you can specify different databases for different groups/environments
group :test, :development do
	gem 'sqlite3'
end

group :production do
	gem 'pg'
end


Then go to the database.yml file in the config folder, where you tell it how to connect to the database


6. What is the seeds file? How do I run it?
A seeds file is used to seed a database with initial data.
Write some code on the db/seeds.rb file then in the terminal, run rake db:seed
