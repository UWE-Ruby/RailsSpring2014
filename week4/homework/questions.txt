Questions:
1. What is ActiveRecord and why is it useful? 

Active Record allows you to access data in a database. It is the Model in the MVC. It allows us to store logic and data to be represented. 

2. What problems could happen if you change a migration file after you have run it and committed it to github? (list 2)

When someone else goes back to create an instance of your file, the migration will be different form yours, since a migration is only run once, and in timestamp order. Donâ€™t mess with migration files. 

3. What problems can you run into with the Rails has_and_belongs_to_many method? (list 2)

If you ever want to go back and add additional associations to tables, you have to go back and manually create join tables, rather than just updating the associations in a model. 

4. How is Rails form_for object oriented?
It is set to default paths, that can all be overwritten inline. 

5. How would I use postgres in production and sqlite for development? What files would I change and how would I change them?

You can set what database you want in the config/database.yml file. For example:

development:
  adapter: mysql2
  database: db1_dev
  username: root
  password: xyz
  host: localhost

development_sec:
  adapter: mysql2
  database: db2_dev
  username: root
  password: xyz
  host: localhost

production:
  adapter: mysql2
  database: db1_prod
  username: root
  password: xyz
  host: your-production-ip

production_sec:
  adapter: mysql2
  database: db2_prod
  username: root
  password: xyz
  host: your-production-ip

6. What is the seeds file? How do I run it?

You run it with rake db:seeds, and it allows you to plant any information into your database that is necessary to run you application, such as city/state abbreviations.
