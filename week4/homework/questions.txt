Code:
  Add 2 relationships to your app:
    1. Has Many (one-to-many)
    2. Has Many Through (many-to-many)
  Add 2 named scopes

Questions:
1. What is ActiveRecord and why is it useful?
ActiveRecord is the "M" in MVC. Active Record is the interface that Rails gives
you between the database and your application.

2. What problems could happen if you change a migration file after you have run it and committed it to github? (list 2)
    1. If you have already run the migration then you cannot just edit the migration and run the migration again: Rails thinks it has
already run the migration and so will do nothing when you run rake db:migrate. You must rollback the migration (for example with rake db:rollback), edit your
migration and then run rake db:migrate to run the corrected version. 
    2. In general, editing existing migrations is not a good idea, it may cause
    inconsistentices if you are working in a team.

3. What problems can you run into with the Rails has_and_belongs_to_many method? (list 2)
The problems with habtm begin once you want to add extra columns to the join table, after which you'll want to
upgrade the relationship to use has_many :through instead because records
returned from join tables with additional attributes will be marked
as read-only, because it's not possible to save changes to those additional
attributes.

Unless the join table is explicitly specified as an option, Rails guesses its
name by concatenating the table names of the joined classes, in alphabetical order and separated with an underscore.




4. How is Rails form_for object oriented?


5. How would I use postgres in production and sqlite for development? What files would I change and how would I change them?
You can change the database.yml and specify for each enviornment (production,
development, etc.) which adapter (postgres, sqlite, etc.) to use.

6. What is the seeds file? How do I run it?
The seeds.rb file is good for populating common static records in the database,
you can run it with "rake db:seed"
