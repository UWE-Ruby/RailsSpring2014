Questions:
1. What is ActiveRecord and why is it useful?

	Active Record is Magic, okay really, Active Record is the "M" in MVC. Active Record is a framework that allows you to create and represent models. I almost see it as a class to interface with a database. You can use active record to an instance of a database row. For example, we can create an instance of a student from the students database using active record. Whate can also use active record to initilize and edit databases, aka "migrations"

2. What problems could happen if you change a migration file after you have run it and committed it to github? (list 2)

	1. The current database, github, and migration file are out of sync. If you were to try and connect your current database with a copy of your app from github, it would run into errors because you haven't committed the latest migrations to github.

	2. It can cause issues with out people on your team.


3. What problems can you run into with the Rails has_and_belongs_to_many method? (list 2)

	1. The joining table seems like it would be easy to overlook and would cause problems if you were to do migrations some where else.
	2. This method is no longer used by many Rails programmers, and they will not be happy with you. ;)


4. How is Rails form_for object oriented?
	I'm having issues with this one. form_for does use the form builder object to create a form, and then methods to create the form are called on that object.

5. How would I use postgres in production and sqlite for development? What files would I change and how would I change them?
	You can edit the database.yml file so you use a different database per environment. You'll want to edit the adapter: parameter to the database type you want to use. There could be extra parameters depending on your configuration.

6. What is the seeds file? How do I run it?

	The seeds file is a file used to generate default (baseline) information for your database. You run it be executing rake db:seed or it is run when you execute rake db:setup.
