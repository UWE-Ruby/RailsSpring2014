Code:
  Add 2 relationships to your app:
    1. Has Many (one-to-many)
    2. Has Many Through (many-to-many)
  Add 2 named scopes

Questions:
1. What is ActiveRecord and why is it useful?
	ActiveRecord is the object that encapsulates and provides access to a row of data from a database table. It also provides the ability to add business logic.

2. What problems could happen if you change a migration file after you have run it and committed it to github? (list 2)
	1. The updated migration would not be run as rails assumes it to be run already.
	2. Any future migrations depending on those changes would be broken.

3. What problems can you run into with the Rails has_and_belongs_to_many method? (list 2)

	1. Adding columns to relationship table would be read-only thus making it very difficult to have attributes on a relationship.

4. How is Rails form_for object oriented?

	form_for takes in a model object(or a corresppnding symbol) as input and turns it into a html form through FormBuilder. 

5. How would I use postgres in production and sqlite for development? What files would I change and how would I change them?
	We need to change database.yml and Gemfile.

	database.yml:
		development:
		  adapter: sqlite3
		  database: db/development.sqlite3
		  pool: 5
		  timeout: 5000

		  .
		  .
		  .

		production:
		  adapter: postgresql
		  encoding: unicode
		  database: rails_homework
		  pool: 5
		  username: user_name
		  password: pwd


	Gemfile:

		# Use sqlite3 as the database for Active Record in test & development
		group :test, :development do
			gem 'sqlite3'
		end

		# Use postgres as the database for Active Record in prod
		gem 'pg', '~> 0.17.1'

6. What is the seeds file? How do I run it?
	
	Seeds file is used to pre-fill the database with required data after setting it up or during setup.

	rake db:seed command is used to run it. rake db:setup would run it too.
