Questions:
1. What is ActiveRecord and why is it useful?
-->ActiveRecord is the overarching class used for Models in the Rails structure.  It is useful because it includes many
methods and properties that can be used to encapsulate your business logic into your Rails objects.
2. What problems could happen if you change a migration file after you have run it and committed it to github? (list 2)
-->12  The changes in the migration file are not incorporated into your database. 2) Any future attempt to recreate your
database state by running the successive migrations will create a different database from what you currently have, making 
your current database schema impossible to replicate again.
3. What problems can you run into with the Rails has_and_belongs_to_many method? (list 2)
-->1).  The join has to occur explicitly in your SQL tables, not in your Rails logic.  This is not transparent.  2)You will
not be able to use callbacks or validate your data in the Rails code, as there is no model to hold this code.
4. How is Rails form_for object oriented?
-->It binds a form to a particular object, generating the HTML required for the form to access the properties of that
object.  You don't have to work with individual properties one at a time, you can deal with the object.
5. How would I use postgres in production and sqlite for development? What files would I change and how would I change them?
-->You would simply change the databases.  You would do that by ensuring that the postgres gem is in the Gemfile file, and 
run 'bundle install' if you had to add the gem.  You then modify the appropriate section of the config/database.yml file 
to indicate which database to run in which environment.
6. What is the seeds file? How do I run it?
-->The seeds file is located in the db/seeds.rb file.  It is how you move the initial data into your database.  After 
writing the data you wish to add to the database in the db/seeds.rb file, you run rake db:seed to move it into your 
database.
